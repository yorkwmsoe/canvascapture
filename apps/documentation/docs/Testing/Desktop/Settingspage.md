## Test Case Name: Connect Canvas Account via Settings Page
- Test Case ID: DesktopApp_TC_002
- Test Priority: High
- Test Objective: To verify that the desktop application successfully connects to the user's Canvas account when the correct Canvas domain and access token are entered in the settings page.

Preconditions:

The desktop application is installed and accessible.
The user is logged in to the desktop application.
The user has navigated to the settings page of the application.
Test Steps:

1. Launch the desktop application.
2. Log in with valid credentials if required.
3. Navigate to the settings page.
4. Locate the fields for entering the Canvas domain and Canvas access token.
5. Enter the correct Canvas domain in the designated field.
6. Enter the correct Canvas access token in the designated field.
7. Click on the "Connect" or "Save" button to apply the entered settings.
8. Wait for the application to process the entered information and attempt to connect to the Canvas account.
9. Check for any error messages or notifications indicating successful or failed connection attempts.

Expected Result:

The settings page should allow the user to enter the Canvas domain and access token.
Upon clicking the "Save" button, the application should attempt to establish a connection to the Canvas account using the provided credentials.
If the entered Canvas domain and access token are correct, the application should connect to the user's Canvas account without any errors.
A success message or notification should confirm the successful connection to the Canvas account.
If there are any errors in the entered credentials or connectivity issues, the application should display appropriate error messages indicating the reason for the failure.
Postconditions:

If the connection is successful, the application should be ready to access and retrieve data from the user's Canvas account.
If the connection fails, the user should be prompted to review and correct the entered Canvas domain and access token, or to check their internet connection if connectivity issues are detected.
Test Data:

Canvas Domain: [Enter a valid Canvas domain]
Canvas Access Token: [Enter a valid Canvas access token]

Notes:
- Ensure that the application handles both correct and incorrect input data gracefully.
- Verify that the application provides clear and informative error messages in case of connection failures or incorrect credentials.
- Test the connectivity under different network conditions to ensure robustness.
