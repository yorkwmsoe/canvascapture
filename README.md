## Project Description

This project is a tool that allows users to capture their work on Canvas, an online learning platform, and generate a pdf file of their work. This feature is beneficial for professors who are undergoing a review process and want to showcase their work to the review committee. By using this tool, professors can easily document their Canvas activities, such as creating courses, uploading assignments, grading students, and providing feedback. The tool also enables professors to customize the layout and format of the pdf file, such as adding a cover page, a table of contents, and page numbers. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and compatible with various devices and browsers.
